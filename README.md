# CMU-Multimodal SDK Version 1.1 (mmsdk)

CMU-Multimodal SDK provides tools to easily load well-known multimodal datasets and rapidly build neural multimodal deep models. Hence the SDK comprises of two modules: 1) mmdatasdk: module for downloading and procesing multimodal datasets using computational sequences. 2) mmmodelsdk: tools to utilize complex neural models as well as layers for building new models. The fusion models in prior papers will be released here. 

# News

--> **Version 1.1 announced**. Social-IQ 1.0 has been released. 

--> **Version 1.0.5 announced**. Two new functions got added: revert and imputate. Revert takes an aligned computational sequence with segment ids (i.e. y[z]) and builds a computational sequence without segment ids (i.e. y) by stacking intervals and features. Imputate fills the gaps in alignment, say computational sequence x does not have segment y[z] then that segment can be filled with say zeros with the same shape as required by x. A reference computational sequence is needed for this purpose to provide intervals. The imputation feature shape will be (1 by shape of x featureset). These two functions take a lot of guess work out of the equation when developing models. Tutorials coming soon :)

--> A nice tutorial on how to use the SDK is prepared by Zhun Liu [here](https://github.com/Justin1904/CMU-MultimodalSDK-Tutorials). SDK should not be considered trivial to use. The machine learning scientists are still involved in a lot of decisions e.g. how to handle cases where some csd has time gaps (like detector fails or nan values). 

--> **Version 1.0.4 announced**. Special thanks to Zhun Liu and Michael Grundie. New features added to CMU-MOSI, CMU-MOSEI and POM datasets. TLDR: Word alignment on CMU-MOSI is substantially improved, therefore the language modality is now working much better - previous alignment for MOSI is now deprecated. This new alignment is not applied to GloVe and BERT, only to the raw words - **hence I removed the glove and BERT for now - if you decide to build your own BERT you should consider running BERT on each segment not on the entire video since it is a contextual word embedding.** New features including OpenFace2, OpenSmile-IS09 are also added. Computational sequences for IEMOCAP are also released (only available by proof of email from USC, the zip file is password protected). Please check the next_steps.md to see where we are going next. 

--> **Old preprocessed datasets used in our papers are available at: http://immortal.multicomp.cs.cmu.edu/raw_datasets/old_processed_data/**. Still we highly recommend using SDK since you will have access to the latest updates for the datasets. 

--> Alignment function on large datasets improved ~40x in speed. CMU-MOSEI now aligns in less than 4 hours. Previously the full dataset took around 2-3 days to fully align, majority of which was spent on alignment function.

--> Have a look at the newly released RAVEN model: https://github.com/victorywys/RAVEN - https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.09362.pdf - tldr: while previously we averaged nonverbal information for each word under assumption that subword nonverbal behaviors are probably mostly constant, we recently discovered that better modeling of subword nonverbal behaviors actually helps a lot! More than we originally anticipated, we are able to achieve competative results with SOTA just using a LSTM on nonverbal shifts in word vectors. 

--> BERT embeddings now available for CMU-MOSI.

--> **Raw data now available for download outside SDK - download from http://immortal.multicomp.cs.cmu.edu/raw_datasets/**. 


## CMU Multimodal Data SDK (mmdatasdk)

CMU-Multimodal Data SDK simplifies downloading and loading multimodal datasets. The module mmdatasdk treats each multimodal dataset as a combination of **computational sequences**. Each computational sequence contains information from one modality in a heirarchical format, defined in the continuation of this section. Computational sequences are self-contained and independent; they can be used to train models in isolation. They can be downloaded, shared and registered with our trust servers. This allows the community to share data and recreate results in a more elegant way using computational sequence intrgrity checks. Furthermore, this integrity check allows users to download the correct computational sequences. 

Each computational sequence is a heirarchical data strcuture which contains two key elements 1) "data" is a heirarchy of features in the computational sequence categorized based on unique multimodal source identifier (for example video id). Each multimodal source has two matrices associated with it: features and intervals. Features denote the computational descriptors and intervals denote their associated timestamp. Both features and intervals are numpy 2d arrays. 2) "metadata": contains information about the computational sequence including integrity and version information. The computational sequences are stored as hdf5 objects on hard disk with ".csd" extension (computational sequential data). Both the data and metadata are stored under "root name" (root of the heirarchy)

A dataset is defined as a dictionary of multiple computational sequences. Entire datasets can be shared using recipes as opposed to old-fashioned dropbox links or ftp servers. Computational sequences are downloaded one by one and their individual integrity is checked to make sure they are the ones users wanted to share. Users can register their extracted features with our trust server to use this feature. They can also request storage of their features on our servers 


## Installation

The first step is to download the SDK:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:A2Zadeh/CMU-MultimodalSDK.git
```

Then add the cloned folder to your `$PYTHONPATH` environment variable. For example, you can do so by adding the following line (replace the path with your actual path of course) to your `~/.bashrc` file. 

```bash
export PYTHONPATH="/path/to/cloned/directory/CMU-MultimodalSDK:$PYTHONPATH"
```

Make sure the following python packages are installed: h5py, validators, tqdm. The setup.py will install them for you. You can also manually install them using pip by:

```bash
pip install h5py validators tqdm numpy argparse requests
```

## Usage

The first step in most machine learning tasks is to acquire the data. We will work with CMU-MOSI for this readme. 

```python
>>> from mmsdk import mmdatasdk
```

Now that mmdatasdk is loaded you can proceed to fetch a dataset. The datasets are a set of computational sequences, where each computational sequence hosts the information from a modality or a view of a modality. For example a computational sequence could be the word vectors and another computational sequence could be phoneme 1-hot vectors. 

If you are using a standard dataset, you can find the list of them in the mmdatasdk/dataset/standard_datasets. We use CMU-MOSI for now. We will work with highlevel features (glove embeddings, facet facial expressions, covarep acoustic features, etc)

```python
>>> from mmsdk import mmdatasdk
>>> cmumosi_highlevel=mmdatasdk.mmdataset(mmdatasdk.cmu_mosi.highlevel,'cmumosi/')
```

This will download the data using the links provided in *mmdatasdk.cmu_mosi.highlevel* dictionary (mappings between computational sequence keys and their respective download link) and put them in the *cmumosi/* folder. 

The data that gets downloaded comes in different frequencies, however, they computational sequence keys will always be the same. For example if video v0 exists in glove embeddings, then v0 should exist in other computational sequences as well. The data with different frequency is applicable for machine learning tasks, however, sometimes the data needs to be aligned. The next stage is to align the data according to a modality. For example we would like to align all computational sequences according to the labels of a dataset. First, we fetch the opinion segment labels computational sequence for CMU-MOSI. 

```python
>>> cmumosi_highlevel.add_computational_sequences(mmdatasdk.cmu_mosi.labels,'cmumosi/')
```

Next we align everything to the opinion segment labels. 

```python
>>> cmumosi_highlevel.align('Opinion Segment Labels')
```

*Opinion Segment Labels* is the key for the labels we just fetched. Since every video has multiple segments according to annotations and timing in opinion segment labels, each video will also be accompanied by a [x] where x denotes which opinion segment the computational sequence information belongs to; for example v0[2] denotes third segment of v0 (starting from [0]). 


**Word Level Alignement:**

In recent papers, it has been a common practice to perform word-level alignment. To do this with the mmdatasdk, we can do the following:

```python
>>> from mmsdk import mmdatasdk
>>> cmumosi_highlevel=mmdatasdk.mmdataset(mmdatasdk.cmu_mosi.highlevel,'cmumosi/')
>>> cmumosi_highlevel.align('glove_vectors',collapse_functions=[myavg])
>>> cmumosi_highlevel.add_computational_sequences(mmdatasdk.cmu_mosi.labels,'cmumosi/')
>>> cmumosi_highlevel.align('Opinion Segment Labels')
```

we first aligned everything to the *glove_vectors* modality and then we align to the *Opinion Segment Labels*. Please note that with the alignment to the *glove_vectors*, we ask the align function to also collapse the other modalities. This basically means summarize the other modalities based on a set of functions. The functions all receive two argument *intervals* and *features*. Intervals is a *m times 2* and features is a *m times n* matrix. The output of the functions should be *1 times n*. For example the following function ignores intervals and just takes the average of the input features:

```python
import numpy
def myavg(intervals,features):
        return numpy.average(features,axis=0)
```

Multiple functions can be passed to *collapse_functions*, each of them will be applied one by one and will be concatenated as the final output.
